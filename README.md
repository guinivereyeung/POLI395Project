Meeting Notes
- Rows for analysis dataset: bills, made to committee (outcome)
- Selection on observables: add controls (sponsors, pro or con, state of sponsoring legislator, lobbying organizations), see what differences were across legislation 
Selection on observables analysis 
- Need multiple control variables
    - Is this trying to restrict guns/make it to acquire 
    - The state of the sponsor of the bill (most important)
    - Control for lobbying organizations
    - Preferably more years
- Outcome variable: did this make it to the floor
    - Did this make it out of level 3 rather than level 4 so we have more variation
